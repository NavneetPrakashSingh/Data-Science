NLP
Applying machine learning models to text and language.
Teaching machines to understand what is being spoken or read
E.g Dictating something into android device which gets converted to  text, is an example of NLP algorithm.
NLP used to predict if the review is a good one or bad one.
NLP to predict category of article in a segment
Most NLP algorithms are classification model:
Logistic regression
Naive Bayes 
CART (based on decision tree)
Maximum Entropy (decision Trees)
Hidden Markov Models (Markov processes)
Bag of words: Model used to preprocess the text to classify before fitting classification algorithms on observations containing text

Steps involved:
Clean text to prepare them for machine learning models
Create a bag of words model
apply machine learning models to bag of words model
